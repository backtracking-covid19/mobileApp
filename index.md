# We want to help

Most of us are alumni of the CSE department at IIT Delhi and have
significant prior experience at developing reliable distributed
computer systems. We want to contribute solutions towards tackling
the ongoing COVID-19 situation.

# App-based tracking system

We believe that a real-time mobile app-based system to track COVID-19
risk can significantly improve the government's response to the ongoing
epidemic. It can also empower individual users to understand the
risks in their surroundings.

# Ongoing efforts

There are multiple similar ongoing efforts in the world currently. But
this is an important enough problem where multiple groups need to
simultaneously apply their minds to achieve a solution.

We are willing to either develop our own solution, or contribute in an
ongoing effort.

Our prior experience and expertise in
computer systems and application development give us unique advantages
that may ultimately result in a solution that is more accurate, more
usable, more reliable, more secure and privacy-preserving.

# Why are we doing this

This
intended effort is not for any personal gain; in fact we are planning
to suspend our ongoing research and industry activities to try and
contribute to this pressing global problem.

# What are we looking for

We are in very early stages of design and evaluation of our intended
system. We want to get in touch with the appropriate
government authorities and other players to understand their
needs, concerns, perceived opportunities, etc. Although, we do have
our own ideas, we would prefer to listen the front-line voices
to understand the best way to support them.
